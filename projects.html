        <h2> On the Intersection of Queerness and Race</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eGvuOMZRLg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> On the Intersection of Queerness and Race, directed by Sophia Henderson and Christina Ioannides, works in collaboration with Fordham Lincoln Centerâ€™s LGBTQ organization, PRISM, to highlight the presence of queer BIPOC students at Fordham. The documentary offers a space for queer people of color to share their experiences and struggles with marginalization due to their identities. The intersection of queerness and race is significantly underrepresented at Fordham University, and the current president of PRISM, Adah Unachukwu, has worked toward making queer spaces safe for BIPOC students. PRISM has worked to make the Fordham community more inclusive and respectful of those who experience this unique intersection of identity. The intersection of queerness and race comes with a complex navigation of everyday life and these students show what that is like at a predominantly  white institution like Fordham University. In addition, the documentary explores how queer students of color have made their mark on the university, from being student leaders, building safe spaces, and making their voices heard. Although this is a step in the right direction, there is more the Fordham Community could be doing to be an inclusive space for queer people of color. The students that we met with share their experiences and their hopes for their future and for the the future that Fordham has to offer for other queer students of color. </p>
