 <h1>Sophia Henderson</h1>
 <p> I'm Sophia and this is my web-portfolio for the Digital Production in New Media Course at Fordham University. I use she/her pronouns. I'm orginally from Northern Virginia, but now I am based out of New York City. I am a senior in the Honors Program at Fordham studying Film & Television and New Media & Digital Design. I dedicate my time to filmmaking, photography, and design as a creative. I've always been passionate about film and have worked to gain skills that will help me with my future. In addition to this class, I have gained skills such as familiarity with the Adobe Creative Suite, film production, and social media strategy. I have done work with The American Pavilion at the Cannes Film Festival and Riddle & Bloom, which have worked with my skills in film and design. </p>
