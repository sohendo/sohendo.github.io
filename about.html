    <p> Welcome! My name is Sophia. I use she/her pronouns. I am a senior in the Honors Program at Lincoln Center, double majoring in Film & Television and New Media & Digital Design. I am originally from Northern Virginia and have lived in New York City for the past four years. At Fordham, I am president of the Black Students Alliance, a member of the Filmmaking Club, and a member of PRISM. I am determined to support and enrich the exerience of minority identities. As a black woman from a Trinidadian immigrant family, my identity has been a driving force in my work and how I navigate my creative vision. As a creative, I dedicate my time to filmmaking, photograhy, and design. I've always been passionate about film and have worked to gain skills that will help me with my future. In addition to this class, I have gained skills such as familiarity with the Adobe Creative Suite, film production, and social media strategy. I have done work with The American Pavilion at the Cannes Film Festival and Riddle & Bloom as an HBOmax Campus Brand Manager, which have worked with my skills in film and design. </p>
